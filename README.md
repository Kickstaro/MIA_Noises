# MIA_Noises

This is the code accompanying the paper for the course AI and law at UZH

We reproduced the the attack method based on the shadow model proposed by Shokri and referenced from “spring-epfl/mia” https://github.com/spring-epfl/mia

In this code, we train a MIA model and added different types and strength of noise in to dataset to see what effect does noise have on the MIA model
